# Run with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Automated Test Suite

### Overview

The project uses a **two-tier testing approach**:

1. **Jest + React Testing Library**: Unit tests for components and utilities
2. **Playwright**: End-to-end tests for user flows and critical functionality

All tests run automatically in CI before deployment.

---

## Unit Testing (Jest)

### Test Framework

- **Jest**: v30.x - JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: v16.x - React component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: v6.x - Custom Jest matchers for DOM
- **jest-environment-jsdom**: Simulates browser environment for tests

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/components/Header.test.tsx

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- -t "Header"
```

### Test File Structure

Unit tests are located in the `__tests__` directory, mirroring the source structure:

```
__tests__/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.test.tsx
│   ├── Footer.test.tsx
│   └── CookieConsent.test.tsx
└── lib/
    └── assetPath.test.ts
```

### Current Test Coverage

**Components Tested**:
- Header (navigation component)
- Footer (footer component)
- CookieConsent (cookie consent banner)

**Utilities Tested**:
- assetPath (asset path helper for GitHub Pages)

**Coverage Threshold**: 5% (initial baseline, will be increased over time)

### Writing Unit Tests

Example component test:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import MyComponent from '../../src/components/MyComponent'

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<MyComponent title="Test" />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Test')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />)
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
    expect(screen.getByText('Clicked')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

Example utility test:

```tsx
import { myUtility } from '../../src/lib/myUtility'

describe('myUtility', () => {
  it('should return correct value', () => {
    expect(myUtility('input')).toBe('expected-output')
  })

  it('should handle edge cases', () => {
    expect(myUtility('')).toBe('')
    expect(myUtility(null)).toBeNull()
  })
})
```

### Test Configuration

**jest.config.js**: Main Jest configuration
- Uses Next.js Jest integration
- Configured for jsdom test environment
- Code coverage collection enabled
- Module path aliases configured

**jest.setup.js**: Test environment setup
- Imports @testing-library/jest-dom for custom matchers
- Can be extended with global test setup

---

## E2E Testing (Playwright)

### Test Framework

**Test Framework**: Playwright v1.56.0  
**Browser**: Chromium (uses system browser to avoid network restrictions)  
**Test Files**: 2 test suites, 6 test cases (5 active, 1 skipped)

### Test Files and Coverage

#### 1. Logo Visibility Tests (`tests/logo.spec.ts`)

Tests that verify the Free For Charity logo displays correctly across the site.

**Test Cases:**

1. **`should display logo in top left corner (NavBar)`**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies logo appears in navigation header
   - **Checks**:
     - Logo element is visible on page
     - Image src ends with `/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`
     - Alt text equals "Free For Charity logo"
   - **Selector**: `header a[aria-label="Free For Charity home"] img[alt="Free For Charity logo"]`

2. **`should display logo in hero section`**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies logo appears in the main hero/landing section
   - **Checks**:
     - Logo element is visible on page
     - Image src ends with `/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`
     - Alt text equals "Free For Charity mark"
   - **Selector**: `section#home img[alt="Free For Charity mark"]`

3. **`both logos should be present on the same page`**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies both logos exist simultaneously and are consistent
   - **Checks**:
     - NavBar logo is visible
     - Hero logo is visible
     - Both logos use identical image source paths
     - Image path pattern matches expected format

#### 2. GitHub Pages Deployment Tests (`tests/github-pages.spec.ts`)

Tests that verify image loading works correctly for both custom domain and GitHub Pages deployments.

**Test Cases:**

4. **`images should load correctly with proper paths`**
   - **Purpose**: Validates image paths work in both deployment scenarios
   - **Checks**:
     - NavBar logo is visible (image loaded successfully)
     - Hero logo is visible (image loaded successfully)
     - Both image src attributes end with `/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`
     - Both logos use identical path
   - **Deployment Compatibility**:
     - Custom domain: `/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`
   - GitHub Pages: `/FFC_Single_Page_Template/web-app-manifest-512x512.png`

5. **`images should return 200 status code`**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies images load successfully via HTTP
   - **Checks**:
     - Captures HTTP responses for logo image
     - At least one image request is made
     - All image requests return status code 200 OK
   - **Method**: Monitors network responses using Playwright's response listener

6. **`images have natural dimensions indicating successful load`** ⏭️ **SKIPPED**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies image has loaded by checking natural dimensions
   - **Status**: Temporarily disabled
   - **Reason**: naturalWidth/naturalHeight return 0 in CI despite image being visible
   - **Expected Behavior**: Should verify 512x512 pixel dimensions
   - **Notes**: Works locally, fails in GitHub Actions. Needs investigation.

### Running Tests

#### Local Development

```bash
# Build the site first
npm run build

# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install chromium

# Run tests in different modes
npm test              # Headless mode (default)
npm run test:headed   # With browser visible
npm run test:ui       # Interactive Playwright UI
```

#### CI/CD Environment

Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions with the following configuration:
- **Trigger**: Every push to main branch
- **Environment**: Ubuntu latest with Node.js 20
- **Browser Setup**: `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`
- **Build**: Built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/FFC_Single_Page_Template`
- **Retry Logic**: Failed tests retry 2 times
- **Failure Handling**: Deployment blocked if tests fail

### Test Configuration

**Playwright Config** (`playwright.config.ts`)

Key settings:
- **Test Directory**: `./tests`
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Parallel Execution**: Enabled (disabled in CI for stability)
- **Retries**: 2 in CI, 0 locally
- **Web Server**: Auto-starts `npm run preview` before tests
- **Browser**: System Chromium (fallback to Playwright's if unavailable)
- **Trace Collection**: On first retry for debugging
- **Reporter**: HTML report

**Special Features**:
- Automatically detects and uses system Chromium browser
- Works in restricted network environments
- Prevents accidental `test.only` in CI

### CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:
- On every push to main branch
- Before deployment to GitHub Pages
- If tests fail, deployment is blocked

## Static Analysis

### ESLint

**Configuration**: `eslint.config.mjs`

- **Rules**: Next.js core-web-vitals + TypeScript
- **Ignored Paths**: node_modules, .next, out, build, test-results, playwright-report
- **Integration**: Runs automatically during `npm run build`

**Current Warnings**:
- 2 warnings about using `<img>` instead of `<Image />` (expected and acceptable)
  - `src/app/components/NavBar.tsx:17:11`
  - `src/app/page.tsx:82:17`
- These warnings are intentional for static export with GitHub Pages basePath support

### TypeScript

**Configuration**: `tsconfig.json`

- **Strict Mode**: Enabled
- **Type Checking**: Runs during build
- **Path Aliases**: Configured for clean imports
- **Target**: ES2017+ with Next.js optimizations

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Type checking (part of build)
npm run build
```

## Security Testing

### GitHub Dependabot

**Status**: ✅ Configuration file created, repository settings required

GitHub Dependabot provides automated dependency management and security updates for this project.

#### Configuration

**Configuration File**: `.github/dependabot.yml` (✅ configured)

**Repository Settings**: Settings → Security & Analysis (⚙️ must be enabled by repository admin)
- Dependency graph (required)
- Dependabot alerts (recommended)
- Dependabot security updates (recommended)

**Monitored Ecosystems**:
1. **npm** - JavaScript/Node.js dependencies in `package.json`
2. **github-actions** - GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`

**Update Schedule**:
- Runs every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- Checks for new versions and security vulnerabilities
- Creates pull requests automatically

**Features Enabled**:
- ✅ **Version Updates**: Checks for newer versions of dependencies weekly
- ✅ **Security Updates**: Automatically creates PRs for known vulnerabilities (runs immediately when detected)
- ✅ **Grouped Updates**: Dependencies grouped by type for easier review
  - Production dependencies (minor + patch updates)
  - Development dependencies (minor + patch updates)
- ✅ **Customized PRs**: Labeled with "dependencies" + ecosystem tags, commit messages prefixed
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 10 open PRs for npm, 5 for GitHub Actions

#### How It Works

**Version Updates**:
1. Dependabot checks for updates based on the weekly schedule
2. Creates a pull request for each group of updates
3. PR includes changelog, commits, and compatibility info
4. Maintainers review and merge the PR

**Security Updates**:
1. GitHub Advisory Database detects a vulnerability
2. Dependabot creates a PR immediately (bypasses schedule)
3. PR updates only the affected dependency to a safe version
4. Marked with security labels for prioritization

#### Monitoring Dependabot

**View Dependabot PRs**:
```bash
# Navigate to your repository on GitHub
# Go to: Pull Requests → Filter by author: dependabot[bot]
```

**View Dependabot Insights**:
- Repository → Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot
- Shows update frequency, PRs created, and alerts

**View Security Alerts**:
- Repository → Security → Dependabot alerts
- Lists all known vulnerabilities with severity ratings

#### Working with Dependabot PRs

**Review Process**:
1. Check the PR description for changes and compatibility notes
2. Review the diff to ensure no breaking changes
3. Wait for CI/CD to complete (tests must pass)
4. Merge if tests pass and changes look good

**Common Commands** (in PR comments):
- `@dependabot rebase` - Rebase the PR against the base branch
- `@dependabot recreate` - Recreate the PR from scratch
- `@dependabot merge` - Merge the PR (if checks pass)
- `@dependabot ignore this dependency` - Stop updates for this dependency
- `@dependabot ignore this major version` - Ignore major version updates

#### Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Review Dependabot PRs regularly (weekly recommended)
- Merge security updates promptly
- Keep grouped updates together when possible
- Test locally for major version updates

⚠️ **Don't**:
- Ignore security alerts
- Let Dependabot PRs pile up (makes conflicts more likely)
- Blindly auto-merge without CI checks passing
- Disable Dependabot without a good reason

#### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Dependabot PRs not appearing
- **Solution**: Check `.github/dependabot.yml` syntax with a YAML validator
- **Solution**: Verify Dependabot is enabled in repository settings (Settings → Security & Analysis → Dependabot alerts and Dependabot security updates)

**Issue**: Dependabot creating too many PRs
- **Solution**: Adjust `open-pull-requests-limit` in `dependabot.yml`
- **Solution**: Increase grouping to combine more updates

**Issue**: Merge conflicts in Dependabot PR
- **Solution**: Comment `@dependabot rebase` on the PR
- **Solution**: Close and reopen PR to trigger recreation

**Issue**: Tests failing on Dependabot PR
- **Solution**: Review the changes and fix test issues in a separate PR
- **Solution**: Use `@dependabot ignore` if the update causes breaking changes

### CodeQL Security Scanning

**Status**: ✅ Enabled

**Location**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

**Scans**:
- JavaScript/TypeScript code
- GitHub Actions workflows

**Schedule**:
- On push to main branch
- On pull requests to main
- Weekly on Mondays at 11:17 PM

**View Results**:
- Repository → Security → Code scanning alerts

### npm audit

Current security status:
```bash
npm audit
```

**Known Issues**:
- Check for any security vulnerabilities and address them promptly
- Use `npm audit fix` to automatically fix vulnerabilities when possible

## Common Issues

### Issue: Admin page blank
**Cause**: External CDN (unpkg.com) blocked or inaccessible  
**Solution**: This is expected in restricted environments. Will work in production.

### Issue: Build fails
**Cause**: Google Fonts network access (per project instructions)  
**Solution**: Temporarily comment out font imports in layout.tsx

### Issue: Content not showing
**Cause**: JSON import error  
**Solution**: Check TypeScript compilation and JSON validity

### Issue: Playwright browser download fails
**Cause**: Network restrictions blocking cdn.playwright.dev  
**Solution**: Uses system Chromium automatically via playwright.config.ts

### Issue: Test times out
**Cause**: Web server didn't start in time  
**Solution**: Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts (currently 120s)
